in this blog i will discuss some important topics of the algorithm and data structures.

first topic is linear search
in linear search we have one array with n elements and we want to find location of any particular element 
so we will have to look one by one each elements untill we get our desired element
in best case its time complexity will be O(1)
in worst and average case its time complexity will be O(n)
